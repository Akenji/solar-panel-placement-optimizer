# Solar Panel Placement Optimizer

## Overview
The **Solar Panel Placement Optimizer** is a Python-based tool designed to determine the BEST GEOMETRIC arrangement and tilt angle of solar panels to maximize sunlight exposure. This project leverages geometric principles, solar positioning algorithms, and optimization techniques to provide practical insights for renewable energy setups.

---

## Features
- **Sunlight Simulation:** Calculate solar azimuth and elevation based on date, time, and location.
- **Tilt Angle Optimization:** Optimize the panel’s tilt and orientation for maximum energy capture.
- **3D Visualization:** Visualize sunlight paths and solar panel placements in 3D.

---

## How It Works
1. **Input:**
   - Geographic location (latitude, longitude).
   - Date and time range.
   - Panel dimensions and initial tilt/orientation.

2. **Simulation:**
   - Computes the sun’s position (azimuth and elevation) throughout the day.
   - Simulates sunlight angles and calculates potential energy capture for various tilt angles.

3. **Optimization:**
   - Uses optimization algorithms (e.g., SciPy’s `minimize`) to find the tilt angle and orientation that maximize energy capture.

4. **Output:**
   - Recommended tilt angle and orientation.
   - Graphs and 3D visualizations of sunlight intensity and panel placement.
